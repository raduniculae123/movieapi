To test the application: 
1. Open the project
2. Run the Main method of the MovieapiApplication Class. (I used Java 17)
3. Open the browser and access localhost:8080/db to view the database (press Connect and should work with default input)
4. Access all the required endpoints on the same port using the next URLs:
  "/movies"
  "/genre/{genre}"
  "/tag/{tag}"
  "/users"
  "users/{id}"
Mentions:
1. The requirements document as I understood it, only required the backend part which was developed in Java Spring, therefore the output when accessing the endpoints will be raw.
2. For the database I opted for an H2 database for ease of user.
3. The lack of comments is from the simplicity of the code.
